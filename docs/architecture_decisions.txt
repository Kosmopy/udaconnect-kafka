Justification of design decisions:

RESTApi is the industry standard and the first choice if are no special reasons to decide differently.
It is used as message passing technique between the frontend client and connection-microservice and between the client and
the person-microservice.
I expect a large volume of location data from app-users to be ingested, therefore, the message queue Kafka, which allows to handle multiple requests
in parallel. To optimize performance, I use gRPC as message passing technique here since it is faster and the restrictions with regards to data format
are an useful error testing mechanism.
